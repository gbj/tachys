### Experimental web UI library for Rust.

This is a playground and exploration space for the future development of a new renderer Leptos 0.6. It uses the concept of a statically-typed view tree, similar to SwiftUI and introduced to the Rust UI space by [Xilem](https://github.com/linebender/xilem) and [Concoct](https://github.com/concoct-rs/concoct/).

This has some *serious* advantages that have not been explored by these other libraries with regard to server-side HTML rendering and extremely efficient and robust hydration, as well as compile-time `<template>` tag building etc. 

Feel free to use this or explore or steal ideas, but **do not expect this to be a maintained library.**

> The name: ταχύς means “fast” or “swift,” which is both a) true (this is quite fast) and b) a bit of a pun, as the method of using statically-typed views is inspired by SwiftUI.
